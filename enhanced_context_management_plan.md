# Enhanced Context Management System for LibraryWalker 10.15

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing LibraryWalker with an advanced context management system using LangChain and multiple AI orchestration. This system will provide a more dynamic, conversation-aware retrieval experience while preserving the core multi-level chunking architecture and the specialized coverage-based retrieval mechanism.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture
- Multi-level chunking (L0, L1, L2+) with metadata implemented in `chunker.py` via `create_multi_level_chunks()`
- Storage-optimized vector database (FAISS with IndexFlatL2) that stores text only for L0 chunks
- `CoverageManager` class for coverage-based retrieval that optimizes context window usage
- Hebrew term expansion via `expand_query_with_hebrew_terms()` and HyDE expansion via `generate_hyde_expansion()`
- Multi-strategy retrieval in `retrieve_with_improved_query()` that selects best results across approaches
- Direct query → retrieval → format context → LLM response flow with no persistent memory

### Enhanced Architecture
- **LangChain** integration for conversation management, context tracking, and agent orchestration
- **Context Manager AI** (Claude) to dynamically adjust context based on conversation history while preserving the `CoverageManager`
- **Prompt Engineering AI** (OpenAI) to construct optimal queries for the vector database, replacing and enhancing Hebrew-specific expansion
- **Result Processing AI** (OpenAI) to evaluate retrieval quality and adjust parameters
- **Coverage-optimized retrieval system** (preserved from current implementation without modification to core algorithms)
- **JSON-structured communication** between components for programmatic integration
- **Incremental context expansion** for token efficiency with overlapping strategy for coherence

## 3. Data Flow and Process

### Query Flow Process
1. **User Input**: User asks a question in any language (typically English)
2. **Conversation Processing**:
   - LangChain memory stores query in history
   - Prompt Engineering AI receives conversation history and current query
   - Generates optimized query and token requirements in JSON format
   - Language detection component identifies query language

3. **Initial Retrieval**:
   - Start with minimal context retrieval (1-2 top chunks)
   - Vector database executes optimized query 
   - Retrieves candidate L0 chunks using existing coverage-based algorithm
   - Formats preliminary context with metadata

4. **Result Evaluation**:
   - Result Processing AI evaluates retrieved context
   - Outputs JSON assessment (sufficient/insufficient)
   - If insufficient, recommends token adjustment and retrieval modifications
   - Uses concrete stopping criteria to determine if more context is needed

5. **Incremental Context Expansion** (if needed):
   - If initial retrieval is insufficient, expand context geometrically (2→4→8 chunks)
   - Use overlapping strategy to retain previously retrieved relevant chunks
   - Continue until LLM has sufficient information or max chunks reached
   - For cross-language queries, employ multilingual query expansion techniques

6. **Context Refinement**:
   - If needed, perform modified retrieval with adjusted parameters
   - Context Manager AI reviews candidate chunks and conversation history
   - Outputs JSON with final L0 chunk selection
   - Employs "lost in the middle" mitigation by prioritizing placement of key information

7. **Response Generation**:
   - Assemble final context from selected L0 chunks using existing formatter
   - Place highest-priority information at beginning or end of context window
   - Send to Chat AI with enhanced scholarly rabbinical system prompt
   - Return response to user in the user's language, with original text citations

8. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Update LangChain memory with interaction results
   - Store successful retrieval patterns for future optimization
   - Cache results for similar queries to improve response time

### A. Code to Preserve (Do Not Modify)

1. **Core Functionality Must Remain Untouched**:
   - CoverageManager class in retriever.py (lines 358-536)
     - Including `__init__` (366-388), `get_candidate_l0_ids` (390-405), `filter_redundant_candidates` (407-440), `process_candidate` (442-487), `get_final_chunks` (489-521), and `print_metrics` (523-536)
   - The multi-level chunking architecture in chunker.py (lines 988-1139)
   - Vector store implementation in vector_store.py (entire file)
     - Particularly VectorStore methods for storage optimization of L0 chunks
     - The index structure using IndexFlatL2 for exact search
   - All ingest pipeline functionality:
     - The entire chunker.py pipeline (except what's being enhanced)
     - All code in ingest/__init__.py, ingest/embedder.py, and ingest/ingest.py

2. **Critical Methods to Keep**:
   - retrieve_relevant_chunks in retriever.py (lines 538-672)
   - retrieve_with_improved_query in retriever.py (lines 112-252) - will be wrapped, not replaced
   - API calling functions in prompter.py:
     - call_claude_api (lines 294-391)
     - call_openai_api (lines 245-292)
   - Utility functions in utils.py (all functions must be preserved)

### B. Code to Replace/Modify

1. **Phase 1: Foundation - Initial Modifications**
   - **chat.py**:
     - Modify `chat_loop` function to integrate LangChain memory (lines 170-183)
     - Add language detection for multilingual support (after line 196)
     - Add new arguments to `main()` for LangChain feature flags (lines 284-297)
     - Update the `log_full_run` function to include memory context (lines 13-168)
     
   - **config.py**:
     - Add new configuration options for LangChain features (after line 37)
     ```python
     # Enhanced context management feature flags

     # LangChain integration settings
     MEMORY_MAX_TURNS = 10  # Maximum conversation history turns to keep
     HISTORY_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # Threshold for history relevance filtering
     ```
     - Update MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS if needed for the LangChain implementation

2. **Phase 2: Agent Implementation - Replacements**
   - **retriever.py**:
     - Replace `expand_query_with_hebrew_terms` (lines 23-73) with multilingual version
     - Enhance `generate_hyde_expansion` (lines 75-110) to use Prompt Engineering AI
     - Add embedding function for multilingual support (new function)
     - **NOTE**: These functions must be preserved as fallbacks with the original implementation

3. **Phase 3: Integration - Extend**
   - **prompter.py**:
     - Enhance system prompt in `create_claude_prompt` (lines 91-146) for the scholarly rabbinical persona
     - Modify `format_context_from_chunks` (lines 16-89) to use Context Manager output
     - Add support for JSON-structured inputs while maintaining backward compatibility
     - Update the truncation logic (lines 147-242) to work with the new context layout
   
   - **retriever.py**:
     - Add code for incremental retrieval with overlapping strategy (after line 252)
     - Implement stopping criteria for retrieval sufficiency (add new functionality)
     - Add wrapper function for the AI-optimized query execution (new function)
     - Add hooks for token adjustment (modify process_candidate method implementation)

   - **bin/chat.py**:
     - Update command-line interface to include new feature flags
     - Modify the main CLI entry point to support LangChain features

### C. Code to Clean Up

1. **Phase 1: Remove Legacy Overlap Functions**
   - After confirming the CoverageManager works properly with the enhanced system, remove:
     - `calculate_overlap` (lines 256-323)
     - `calculate_text_overlap` (lines 325-356)
     - Add deprecation notices if we choose to keep them for backward compatibility

2. **Phase 2: Clean Up Redundant Debug Output**
   - In retriever.py:
     - Standardize all debug prints (especially those in retrieve_with_improved_query and retrieve_relevant_chunks)
     - Add proper logging at lines 145-156, 168-195, 614-626, 649-654
   - In prompter.py:
     - Clean up debug prints related to prompt size (lines 153-242)
   - In chat.py:
     - Standardize debug output (lines 257-280)
   - Implement structured logging throughout the codebase

3. **Phase 3: Standardize Error Handling**
   - Address inconsistent error handling in:
     - retriever.py try/except blocks (lines 36-73, 76-110)
     - prompter.py API calling functions (lines 245-391)
     - chat.py main chat loop (lines 214-281)

4. **Phase 4: Configuration Standardization**
   - Consolidate duplicate configurations:
     - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_MODEL references across files
     - OPENAI_API_KEY and model references
     - Embedding model configurations
   - Ensure consistent environment variable handling
   - Add detailed documentation for each configuration parameter

### D. New Code to Add

   - Create test suite that validates each agent's functionality independently
   - Add integration tests for the complete workflow
   - Test each feature flag individually and in combination
   - Verify performance in degraded mode (when APIs are unavailable or slow)

2. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Create benchmark framework to measure before/after performance
   - Test token efficiency improvements
   - Measure conversation coherence metrics
   - Track retrieval quality metrics (precision, recall, F1 score)
   - Document any tradeoffs between performance and quality

3. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Verify that error messages are helpful and clear
   - Ensure the CLI experience remains consistent
   - Test recovery from various error conditions
   - Document any changes in expected behavior

4. **Migration Approach**:
   - Enable feature flags one at a time with careful monitoring
   - Implement gradual rollout starting with memory, then query enhancement, then result processing, and finally context management
   - Keep all original code paths working as fallbacks
   - Document any behavioral differences for users

This cleanup strategy ensures we maintain a clean, consistent codebase while implementing the enhanced context management system. Each phase of implementation should be accompanied by the corresponding cleanup steps to prevent technical debt accumulation.

## 12. Conclusion

This enhanced context management system preserves the core strength of LibraryWalker's multi-level chunk architecture while adding the intelligence of multiple LLMs to optimize the retrieval and conversation experience. By leveraging LangChain for orchestration, the system can maintain conversation coherence while dynamically adjusting the context window based on user needs.

The implementation can be completed in phases, with each component adding value independently. The final system will provide a scholarly conversational experience that feels like interacting with a knowledgeable Rabbi who can recall specific information from the vast Jewish text library and maintain context across a complex conversation.

The system's multilingual capabilities will be designed to present ancient texts in their original languages while providing accessible explanations in the user's language. Unlike conventional RAG systems, this implementation will never filter out texts based on language, recognizing that the source materials (some dating back thousands of years) are intrinsically valuable in their original form. Instead, the system will focus on enhancing the contextual explanations around these original texts, creating a scholarly experience that bridges ancient wisdom with modern conversation.

This approach gives users the experience of speaking with a learned scholar who can seamlessly move between ancient texts and modern explanation, providing both the authentic voice of tradition and the contextual understanding needed for meaningful engagement.


Here's a detailed enhancement of your design, providing specific implementation logic, LangChain integration strategies, code examples, and clarifying precisely how each component interacts. This enhancement explicitly addresses your requirements for multilingual querying, ancient-text prioritization, original-language citation, and a scholarly, rabbinical conversational experience.

# Enhanced Context Management System for LibraryWalker 10.15
## Implementation Logic, Code Examples, and LangChain Integration

Below is a detailed breakdown of each component, followed by practical code examples using LangChain. 

---

## 1. LangChain Integration Layer

LangChain acts as the central orchestrator and memory handler:

### Specific Logic:

- **Conversation Memory**:
  - Stores full chat history.
  - Tracks retrieved chunk metadata across turns.
  - Tracks user's language and original-text languages.
  - Implements `ConversationSummaryMemory` for efficient context retention.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus"), memory_key="chat_history")
```

- **Language Detection** (using OpenAI):
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

language_detector = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo")

language_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Detect language of this query: '{query}'. Respond with just language name."
)
```

---

## 2. Context Manager AI (Claude)

Claude manages which chunks remain in context:

### Logic:

- Receives conversation history, chunk metadata, CoverageManager's selections.
- Evaluates relevance based on user's needs.
- Outputs explicit JSON of selected/excluded chunk IDs.
- Prioritizes original texts irrespective of language, providing clear multilingual context explanations.

### Example Claude Context Manager Prompt:
```markdown
You are managing the chat context window. Given the conversation history, user's latest query, and retrieved chunks, decide explicitly:
- Which chunks (by ID) to include or exclude.
- How to order them to avoid information getting lost in the middle.
- Generate concise conversation summaries when context grows large.
- Always keep ancient original-text chunks intact; supplement them with explanations in user's language.

Output JSON:
{
  "selected_chunks": ["chunk_id_1", "chunk_id_3"],
  "excluded_chunks": ["chunk_id_2"],
  "chunk_ordering": ["chunk_id_3", "chunk_id_1"],
  "conversation_summary": {"include_in_prompt": true, "summary_text": "..."},
  "additional_instructions": "..."
}
```

---

## 3. Prompt Engineering AI (OpenAI)

Generates optimized queries for multilingual retrieval:

### Logic:

- Constructs optimized multilingual queries.
- Implements token-budget estimation.
- Creates HyDE expansions for difficult queries.

### Example OpenAI Prompt Engineer:
```python
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
Given the user's question "{query}" and conversation history:
1. Identify query languages.
2. Generate multilingual optimized query expansions.
3. Estimate tokens required.

Output JSON strictly as follows:
{{
  "optimized_query": "...",
  "detected_language": "...",
  "hyde_content": "...",
  "token_requirement": {{"minimum": ..., "optimal": ..., "maximum": ...}},
  "language_expansions": {{"hebrew": true, "aramaic": true, "yiddish": false}},
  "query_strategy": {{"primary_strategy": "hyde"}}
}}
""")
```

---

## 4. Result Processing AI (OpenAI)

Evaluates retrieval results for completeness and sufficiency:

### Logic:

- Checks if retrieved chunks address the query.
- Recommends whether additional retrieval is needed.
- Provides chunk-level semantic redundancy checks.

### Example Result Processor Logic:
```python
evaluation_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
Evaluate retrieved chunks for sufficiency to answer: "{query}"
Retrieved chunks: {chunks_json}

Output JSON strictly as follows:
{{
  "quality_assessment": "partial",
  "stopping_decision": "continue",
  "token_adjustment": {{"current": 1500, "recommended": 2500}},
  "chunk_analysis": [...],
  "information_gaps": ["Lacking detailed commentary from Rashi"],
  "strategy_adjustments": {{"recommended_actions": ["retrieve more chunks focused on Rashi"]}}
}}
""")
```

---

## 5. Enhanced Scholarly Rabbinical Chat AI (Claude)

Claude handles final chat response, respecting multilingual scholarly needs:

### Scholarly Persona Prompt:
```markdown
You are a revered Rabbi and scholar knowledgeable in ancient texts, capable of seamlessly discussing topics across Hebrew, Aramaic, Yiddish, and English sources. Always cite original sources explicitly in their original language, providing clear explanatory translations into the user's language.

Example Response:
- "The Talmud (Bava Metzia 59b) states: 'לא בשמים היא' ('It is not in heaven'). As Rashi clarifies, this emphasizes the authority of human interpretation..."

Include scholarly phrases like "As Rambam teaches...", "The Vilna Gaon elucidates...", etc.
```

---

## 6. Retrieval and Query Workflow Implementation (LangChain)

Complete LangChain Workflow Example:
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Tool: Multi-Resolution Retriever (Custom wrapper)
def multi_res_retriever(query, token_limit, language_filters):
    # Your custom multi-level retrieval logic here
    return retrieve_with_improved_query(query, token_limit, language_filters)

retrieval_tool = Tool(
    name="MultiResRetriever",
    func=multi_res_retriever,
    description="Retrieves scholarly text chunks using multi-resolution vector search."
)

# Initialize Prompt Engineering Chain
prompt_engineer_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    prompt=prompt_template
)

# Initialize Context Manager Chain
context_manager_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus"),
    prompt=context_manager_prompt
)

# Initialize Result Processor Chain
result_processor_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    prompt=evaluation_prompt
)

# Initialize Main Agent with LangChain
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[retrieval_tool],
    llm=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus"),
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)
```

---

## 7. Incremental Retrieval Logic Example:

```python
def incremental_retrieval(query):
    token_limit = 1000
    all_chunks = []
    for attempt in [1, 2, 4, 8]:
        chunks = multi_res_retriever(query, token_limit * attempt, language_filters=None)
        result_eval = result_processor_chain.run({"query": query, "chunks_json": json.dumps(chunks)})
        eval_json = json.loads(result_eval)

        all_chunks.extend(chunks)
        if eval_json["stopping_decision"] == "stop":
            break

    final_context = context_manager_chain.run({
        "conversation_history": memory.load_memory_variables({}),
        "query": query,
        "chunks_json": json.dumps(all_chunks)
    })

    return final_context
```

---

## 8. Multilingual and Ancient Text Handling:

### Logic for Not Filtering by Query Language:
- Do NOT exclude ancient texts based on user query language.
- Always retrieve texts across all languages relevant to the query.
- Provide original texts with user-language explanations.

```python
# Example multilingual retrieval call
multi_res_retriever("laws of lost property", token_limit=2000, language_filters=None)
```

---

## 9. Response Formatting with Original and Translated Citations:

```markdown
The Talmud states (Bava Metzia 21a):

> "אלו מציאות שלו ואלו חייב להכריז"  
> ("These findings belong to him, and these he must announce.")

Here, the Gemara differentiates types of lost property. Rashi explains this passage, noting...

(Original Hebrew and English translation seamlessly combined.)
```

---

## Conclusion

This comprehensive enhancement provides explicit implementation logic, practical code examples using LangChain, and detailed considerations for multilingual, scholarly, and ancient-text-oriented interactions. The final system delivers an authentic rabbinical scholarly experience, bridging ancient wisdom and modern dialogue seamlessly, clearly, and efficiently.
